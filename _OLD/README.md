## Description
Lost Artist Clothing Collaboration is a place where fashion designers from the upper midwest states - locations typically overlooked in the fashion community - can feature and sell their work. We give designers the ability to create profiles to share who they are, their experience, and a platform for shoppers to connect with them for potentially commissioned work, exposure, and a place to show support for their local designers and community.
